	<h1> How Rockets Fly </h1>
	<h5> Note: First look at a diagram of a bottle rocket, and try building one<a href="/htmlPack/RocketInstructions.html"> here</a>! Also,
		if you aren't afraid of rigorous calculus, and have some background in physics, read<a href="/htmlPack/wrocket.pdf"> this pdf</a>.</h5>

	<h3> Introduction: </h3>
	<p>
		With just some water and some high-pressure air, you can send a a two liter bottle to the clouds. It's not Rocket Science. Except it is. <br> <br>
		Before you can learn how a water bottle rocket works, there are a few Laws of Physics you must be acquanted with. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Conservation of momentum</b>: the momentum of an object in a closed system is conserved. <br>
		<br>
		<b> Newtons Laws of Motion: </b> <br>
		<br>
		1) Objects in Motion stay in motion, objects at rest stay at rest, unless an outside force is applied. <br>
		<br>
		2) Force equals mass times acceleration <br>
		<br>
		3) Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, or forces come in pairs.<br>
		<br>
		Try to familiarize yourself with the terms, lift, drag, thrust, weight.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Drag</b>- forces acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid<br>
		<br>
		<b>Lift</b>- the component of the force, from a fluid flowing past the surface of the body, that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Thrust</b>- the force generated by propulsion<br>
		<br>
		<b>Weight</b>- the quantity of matter contained by it, giving rise to a downward force<br>
		<br>

	<h3> The actual Rocket Science: </h3>
		
		<p>
		A water rocket uses the same physics as a model rocket or the Shuttle launch vehicle.  Very simply, a rocket engine uses high pressure to force a 
		fluid through a restricted opening at a high velocity and this creates a force that propels the launch vehicle in the opposite direction from the 
		exhausting fluid. </p>
		<p>
		Technically, a fluid is either a gas or a liquid.  In chemical rockets, the fluid is a superheated gas generated from a burning fuel.  In a water 
		rocket, the temperatures are normally near outside temperatures and the fluid is a combination of gas and liquid, the gas being normally air
		(although carbon dioxide, or nitrogen are also sometimes used and a hydrogen-oxygen mix is used for a hydrogen rocket) and the liquid being water
		(though it could be mixed with salt or bubble bath or other ingredients). </p> 
		<p>
		It is important to note that the more dense the liquid is, the larger force it will create. This is due to the fact that compressible liquids enhance
		the thrust. This is due to the increase in specific impulse. The specific impulse is the force with respect to the amount of propellant used per unit time.
		The altitude and flight duration are dependent upon the volume of water, the initial pressure, the rocket nozzle's size, and the unloaded weight of the rocket. 
		</p>
		<p>
		It is Newton’s laws at work and especially his third law of motion simply stated as “Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.”
		</p>
		<p>
		Air pressure is basically how hard the air inside the rocket is pushing on the water in the rocket. Because the internal
		air pressure is so much more than the external air pressure, all of the water inside the rocket is pushed out. The greater the difference in air 
		pressure, the faster the water comes out. 
		</p>
		<p>
		What actually pushes the rocket forward is the water coming out of the rocket. Hence the force with which the water is propelling the rocket upward 
		will be the thrust force.</p>
		<p>
		According to the setup, the bottle is partly filled with water and sealed. The bottle is then pressurized with air. The pressure provides
		 a means to store potential energy. When the the bottle cannot support the pressure inside the bottle any longer, the bottle lifts off the ground in a 
		 display of Newton's Third Law of Motion
		</p>
		<p>
		The air pushes water out of the rocket, which hits the ground, and a shockwave passes through the water, pushing it upward. The seal on the nozzle of 
		the rocket is then released and rapid expulsion of water occurs at high speeds until the propellant has been used up and the air pressure inside the rocket 
		drops to atmospheric pressure. There is a net force created on the rocket in accordance with Newton's third law. The propulsion caused by the water thus 
		can cause the rocket to leap a considerable distance into the air.
		</p>
		<p>
		The amount of water used in the rocket makes a huge difference in the altitude reached. Actually, using no water at all but simply using the compressed air for 
		thrust can propel an aerodynamically efficient water rocket to surprising altitudes. If you put too much water in, then the thrust available must loft more weight,
		which reduces the maximum altitude. An air only rocket can fly higher than one with too much water.
		</p>
		<p>
		However, if too little water is used, then there isn’t enough reaction mass to propel the rocket most efficiently. The exact most efficient amount of water varies 
		depending on the overall empty weight of the rocket and whether or not a launch tube is used.
		</p>
		<p>
		Therefore, the more the rocket weighs, the more water the rocket needs to reach the maximum altitude. On the contrary, the longer the launch rod, the less water it needs.
		Also notice that with a launch tube, actually the heavier rocket reaches a higher altitude.  That is because by using the pressure working against the launch tube, the 
		launch tube can impart a greater momentum so the inertia will carry it farther. It combines the affect of a bullet in a gun and a rocket motor.
