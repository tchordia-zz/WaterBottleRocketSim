	<h1> How Rockets Fly </h1>
	<h6> Note: First look at a diagram of a bottle rocket, and try building one <a href="RocketInstructions.html">here</a>! Also,
		if you aren't afraid of a bit of calculus, look at the rigorous mathematics <a href="RocketMath.html">here</a></h6>

	<h3> Intro: </h3>
	<p>
		Rockets are a great way to spice up a sleepy Saturday morning. With just some water, some high-pressure air,
		
		and maybe a few friends, you can send a a two liter bottle to the clouds. It's not Rocket Science. Except it is. <br> <br>
		Before you can learn how a water bottle rocket works, there are a few Laws of Physics you must be acquanted with. <br>
		Conservation of momentum: the momentum of an object in a closed system is conserved. <br>
		Newtons Laws of Motion: <br>
		  1) Objects in Motion stay in motion, objects at rest stay at rest, unless an outside force is applied. <br>
		  2) F=ma <br>
		  3) Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, or forces come in pairs.<br>

	<h3> Rocket Science: </h3>

		What propels a Water Bottle Rocket?
	</p>
	<p>	
		3 factors are involved in the flight our rocket: Internal Air Pressure, Water, and Aerodynamics. <br> <br>
		Air pressure is basically how hard the air inside the rocket is pushing on the water in the rocket. Because the internal
		air pressure is so much more than the external air pressure, all of the water inside the rocket is pushed out. The greater the difference in air 
		pressure, the faster the water comes out. 
	</p>
	<p>
		
		What actually pushes the rocket forward is the water coming out of the rocket.  <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		a) The air pushes water out of the rocket, which hits the ground, and a shockwave passes through the water, pushing it up
		<br>
		b) The air leaving the rocket
		<br>
		c) The high pressure
		<br>
